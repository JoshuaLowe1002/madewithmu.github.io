Friend of Mu and community supporter extraordinaire [Les Pounder](https://twitter.com/biglesp) writes [a blog](https://bigl.es/)
containing lots of quick, fun and beginner-friendly projects. He calls this
sort of thing "tinkology" -- a term I really like. Playful tinkering is
such a wonderful way to learn and relax. Can you guess what editor he uses?
Nope, it's not EMACS or VI. ;-)

What I love about Les's blogging is its consistency: there's always something
new and it's always really imaginative and fun. Les is a great source of ideas
for lessons, projects or learning activities for beginner programmers. For
instance, on most Tuesdays he writes a "Tooling Tuesday" entry to his blog and
many of these have a Python slant to them. Other related series of posts
include "Micro:bit Monday" and "Friday Fun".

Mu related highlights include:

* [Friday Fun: Python Pollen Projects](https://bigl.es/friday-fun-python-pollen-projects/)
* [Tooling Tuesday - Python3 GeoPy](https://bigl.es/tooling-tuesday-python3-geopy/)
* [Tooling Tuesday - Google Image Search With Python](https://bigl.es/tuesday-tooling-google-image-search-with-python/)
* [Tooling Tuesday - easygui](https://bigl.es/tooling-tuesday-easygui/)

Any of these could form the basis of a cool project, set of lessons or after
school code-club activity. So, here's to Les, his blog and fantastically
imaginative projects.

Thank you Les!
