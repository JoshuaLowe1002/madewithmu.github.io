[Caitlinsdad](https://www.instructables.com/member/caitlinsdad/) has created
colourful [Rainbow Pride Traffic Lights](http://www.instructables.com/id/Rainbow-Pride-Traffic-Lights/) with Mu and CircuitPython.
This is great timing since [Pride month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pride#LGBT_Pride_Month)
just finished and **today** tens of thousands of people are taking part in
the [Pride in London Parade](https://prideinlondon.org/parade/). 
Thanks to [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) for the heads-up!

Thanks to some epic cardboard crafting, Neopixels, a healthy dollop of paint
and experimentation with timings in the CircuitPython code, the results
are a customizable rainbow light-show:
