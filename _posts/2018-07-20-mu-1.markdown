We're pleased to announce the release of
[Mu 1.0.0](https://codewith.mu/en/download), a Python code editor for beginner
programmers!
There have been only minor changes since the release candidate, full details
of which can be found in the
[changelog](https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#id1). As always,
feedback and bug reports are most welcome. We've also completed and updated
the [tutorials](https://codewith.mu/en/tutorials/) on the website.

Many people have been involved in getting Mu to 1.0, and, if you use Mu, it
would be a wonderful gesture if you could thank them via social media. Details
of who to thank can be [found here](https://codewith.mu/en/thanks).

Some interesting facts and figures about Mu:

* [34 people have contributed code](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/graphs/contributors).
* There are currently only 3907 lines of Python code in Mu.
* We have 100% unit test coverage.
* Our code quality rating on [LGTM is A+](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/mu-editor/mu/context:python).
* There have been 1115 commits since the project was
  [started on 7th December 2015](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/commit/98f4ea0ba1e5fe44a6378bece7fa92db0a50354f).
* We've closed 341 issues.
* We have [extensive developer documentation](https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
* Our [online chat](https://gitter.im/mu-editor/general) is growing.

Finally, earlier this week, we had our first ever Mu-moot in the MUseum Tavern
in London. Not everyone could make it, but the photo below is of most of the
core contributors:

Everyone went away with an exclusive Mu t-shirt, the custom designs for which
I'll post on social media.

But before doing anything else, I'm going on holiday for a week. :-)
