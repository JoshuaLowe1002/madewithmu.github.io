[EuroPython](https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/) (one of the world's largest,
most friendly and culturally diverse [Python](http://python.org/) programming
conferences) happened last week in Scotland. Sadly, for personal reasons, I was
unable to attend. However, it was great to hear via social media that Mu was
used in the opening conference keynote by Pythonista-extraordinaire
[David Beazley](http://dabeaz.com/). Not only is it wonderful to see Mu used
by someone so well respected in the Python community at such an auspicious
occasion, but David's use of Mu is a wonderful example of Mu's use as a
pedagogical tool. Remember, Mu is not only for learners, but is also for
those who support them (i.e. teachers).

What do I mean by pedagogical tool?

The stereotypical example is a
blackboard upon which the teacher chalks explanations, examples and exercises
for their students. Teaching involves a lot of performative explanation --
showing, telling and describing things as you go along; traditionally with the
aid of a blackboard. This is a very effective pedagogical technique since
students can interrupt and ask questions as the lesson unfolds.

David used Mu as a sort of interactive coding blackboard in his keynote 
introducing the [Thredo project](https://github.com/dabeaz/thredo). He even
encouraged listeners in the auditorium to interrupt as he live-coded his
Python examples.

David and I have never met in real life, although our paths have crossed online
via Python (and, incidentally, via our shared love of
[buzzing down long brass tubes](https://twitter.com/ntoll/status/917722767985971200)).
So I emailed him to find out how he found using Mu. Here are some extracts from
his reply (used with permission):

> There are some who seem to think that one should start off using a fancy IDE
> such as PyCharm, VSCode, Jupyter Lab or something along those lines and start
> piling on a whole bunch of complex tooling.  I frankly disagree with a lot of

This sort of feedback makes me incredibly happy. David obviously "gets it" and
I hope his example points the way for others to exploit the potential of Mu as
a pedagogical tool. David also gave some helpful suggestions which I hope we'll
address in the next release.

David's keynote is a fascinating exposition of what you may want from a
Pythonic threading library -- it also has a wonderful twist at the end which
made me smile. I'd like to encourage you to watch the whole presentation either
via [EuroPython's live video stream of the event](https://youtu.be/FsvmT2Ir7B8?t=26m)
or David's own screen cast of the keynote, embedded below:

Finally, the exposure of Mu via EuroPython had a fun knock on effect: someone
submitted the [Mu website](https://codewith.mu/) to
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (one of the world's most popular
news aggregation websites for programmers). By mid-afternoon Mu was voted the
top story and I had lots of fun [answering people's questions and reading their
comments relating to Mu](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17638067).

My favourite comment, which I'll paraphrase below, will become Mu's tag-line:

> "Python is a language that helps make code readable, Mu is an editor that
> helps make code writeable."
