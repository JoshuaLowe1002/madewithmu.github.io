It'll soon be [PyWeek](https://pyweek.org/)! Why not use Mu for a week of
Pythonic game making fun? Your prize will be
[fun of taking part](https://pyweek.org/26/) and the respect of your peers.

I wrote [my first game](/mu/pygame/pygamezero/2018/06/22/paperchase.html) as
an entry for the last PyWeek, and came a
[respectable 8th out of 23](https://pyweek.org/25/ratings/). I was able
to use Mu's [PyGameZero mode](https://codewith.mu/en/tutorials/1.0/pgzero) to
quickly create something goofy yet fun. My starting point was the easy to
follow [PyGameZero tutorial](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html).
I like to think it amateur, rather than amateurish:

</div><br/>

It was a huge amount of fun, the community involved is friendly and supportive
and I'd like to encourage as many people to enter for the upcoming competition.

What's involved? 

The PyWeek challenge:

1. Invites entrants to write a game in one week from scratch either as an individual or in a team,
2. Is intended to be challenging and fun,
3. Will hopefully increase the public body of game tools, code and expertise,
4. Will let a lot of people actually finish a game, and
5. May inspire new projects (with ready made teams!)

<br/>
Entries must be developed in Python during the challenge, and must incorporate
some theme decided at the start of the challenge.
