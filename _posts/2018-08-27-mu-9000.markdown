Ever wanted a pathalogically conflicted artifical intelligence for your own
home? Why, of course you do! [Adafruit's CRICKIT board](https://learn.adafruit.com/hal-9000-replica/updating-with-crickit)
has you covered (along with instructions for how to program it via Mu).

The [Crickit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3093) (**C**reative **R**obotics
and **I**nteractive **C**onstruction **Kit**) is a an add-on for the
[Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) board. 
Cricket aims to make it easy to make *friendly* robots and thus make friends
with robots (now there's a sentiment we can all get behind). Essentially,
Crickit complements and amplifies the CPX board by making it extraordinarily
easy to interact with robotic "bits and bobs".

What I love about this project is how simple it is to make and program. Once
complete, just press the glowing red button to hear audio clips of HAL. The
[source code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/HAL-9000/code.py)
is less than 50 lines of Python and, perhaps most importantly, you have a
chance to replace the recordings so *your* HAL is no longer an uncooperative
controller of on-board systems, but perhaps a friendly computer in the spirit
of Cricket. What's more, this project is relatively easy to modify to other
concepts such as responsive cuddly toys or the world's most friendly door bell
(remember those doors from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?).

Happy hacking!
