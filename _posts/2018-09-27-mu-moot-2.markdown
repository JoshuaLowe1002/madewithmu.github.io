[Sign up for free](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mu-moot-20-tickets-50730465187)
for the second ever Mu-moot! Thursday October 18th at 6pm in the offices
of [Kano](https://kano.me) at [3 Finsbury Ave, London, EC2M 2PA](https://goo.gl/maps/wvix9nMGfDK2).
It's a friendly and supportive meeting for learners, teachers and software
developers interested in computing, mentoring, technology, pedagogy,
programming and education. While Mu provides a focus for our meetings we are
not limited to Mu related activities, discussions or presentations. Rather,
Mu-moot is a place to encounter new ideas, share knowledge and meet a diverse
group of like-minded people.

What will we be doing?

* We'll start with a welcome of pizza and refreshments from our wonderful hosts
  at Kano.
* Things will kick of properly at 6:30pm with a presentation on the short,
  medium and long term future plans for Mu. This will be followed by a short
  question and answer session.
* Next comes 15 minutes for lightning talks. If you'll be there and have
  something to share, this is where and when you tell us!
* We end with a practical workshop called, "Debugging With Mu - What is
  debugging? Why do I need it? How do I do it?".

At the end, around 8pm-ish, we'll find a local pub and continue our discussions
in a more relaxed atmosphere.

Future Mu-moots look to be even more interesting. [Dan Pope](https://twitter.com/lordmauve), one of the
originators of Mu, will be presenting and running a workshop about
[PyGameZero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) at the November moot. [Tim Golden](https://twitter.com/tjguk), one of Mu's most prolific
contributors, will hopefully present and run a workshop about [NetworkZero](https://networkzero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
at the December-moot.
