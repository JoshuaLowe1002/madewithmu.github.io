The [latest version of Mu](https://codewith.mu/en/download) is here! Version
[1.0.1](https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#id1) is a bug-fix
release and all but one of the thirty or more contributions, changes and fixes
were made by members of our community. I'm especially proud that this update
means Mu supports the following translations: German, Spanish, French,
Japanese, Polish, Portuguese (including Brasil), Swedish, Vietnamese and
Chinese. Apparently there are Greek and Turkish translations on the way.

We expect the next version of Mu with new features (Python 3.7, some new modes,
improvements to configuration, more bug fixes and better translations) to
arrive some-time towards the end of this year.

If you spot any bugs, please don't [hesitate to let us know](https://codewith.mu/en/howto/bugs).

Once again, many thanks to all the people in our community who have made such
important and helpful contributions: René Raab, Limor Fried, GitHub user
